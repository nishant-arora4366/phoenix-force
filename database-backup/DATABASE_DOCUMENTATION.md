## Performance Optimizations

### Indexes
- Primary key indexes on all tables
- Foreign key indexes for relationships
- Status-based indexes for filtering
- Composite indexes for common queries

### Query Optimization
- Efficient slot management queries
- Optimized waitlist position calculations
- Fast auction bid lookups
- Efficient notification queries

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Supabase Auth integration
- JWT token validation
- User session management

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Function-level permissions
- Row-level security policies
- API endpoint protection

### Data Protection
- Input validation in functions
- SQL injection prevention
- Proper error handling
- Audit trail capabilities

## Migration and Deployment

### Fresh Installation
1. Run `COMPLETE_DATABASE_SETUP.sql` on new database
2. Configure Supabase Auth settings
3. Set up environment variables
4. Test all functions and policies

### Updates and Maintenance
- Functions can be updated individually
- Policies can be modified as needed
- Schema changes require careful migration
- Always backup before major changes

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
```sql
-- Check function health
SELECT proname, prosrc FROM pg_proc WHERE pronamespace = (SELECT oid FROM pg_namespace WHERE nspname = 'public');

-- Check policy status
SELECT tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Check trigger status
SELECT trigger_name, event_manipulation, action_statement FROM information_schema.triggers WHERE trigger_schema = 'public';
```

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor slow queries
- Check index usage
- Monitor function execution times
- Track RLS policy performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Function not found**: Check if function exists and has proper permissions
2. **RLS policy blocking**: Verify user role and policy conditions
3. **Trigger not firing**: Check trigger definition and function
4. **Permission denied**: Verify user has required role and status

### Debug Commands
```sql
-- Check user role and status
SELECT role, status FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid();

-- Check function permissions
SELECT has_function_privilege('function_name', 'EXECUTE');

-- Check RLS status
SELECT relname, relrowsecurity FROM pg_class WHERE relrowsecurity = true;
```
