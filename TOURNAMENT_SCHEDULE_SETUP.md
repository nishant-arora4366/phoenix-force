# Tournament Schedule Upload Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the tournament schedule upload functionality for Phoenix Force.

## ðŸš€ **Quick Setup**

### 1. **Supabase Storage Configuration**

You need to manually create the storage bucket in your Supabase dashboard:

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to Storage**
3. **Create a new bucket** with these settings:
   - **Name**: `tournament-schedules`
   - **Public**: âœ… **Yes** (checked)
   - **File size limit**: `10485760` bytes (10MB)
   - **Allowed MIME types**: `image/jpeg,image/jpg,image/png,image/webp`

### 2. **Run Storage Setup Script**

```bash
cd database-setup
node setup-tournament-schedule-storage.js
```

This will set up the RLS policies and helper functions.

### 3. **Manual SQL Setup (Alternative)**

If the script doesn't work, run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create storage bucket for tournament schedules
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'tournament-schedules',
  'tournament-schedules',
  true,
  10485760, -- 10MB in bytes
  ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp']
) ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Enable RLS on storage.objects
ALTER TABLE storage.objects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: Allow tournament hosts and admins to upload schedules
CREATE POLICY "Tournament hosts and admins can upload schedules" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'tournament-schedules' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  AND (
    -- Check if user is admin
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM users 
      WHERE id = auth.uid() 
      AND role = 'admin'
    )
    OR
    -- Check if user is tournament host
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM tournaments t
      JOIN users u ON u.id = t.host_id
      WHERE t.id::text = (storage.foldername(name))[2]
      AND u.id = auth.uid()
      AND u.role = 'host'
    )
  )
);

-- Policy: Allow public read access to tournament schedules
CREATE POLICY "Tournament schedules are publicly readable" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (
  bucket_id = 'tournament-schedules'
);
```
